# STM32f411e_loading_lights

Made in stm32cubeIDE. You also need some cables, wires and extra gadgets then connet them accordingly for this code to work correctly, this is only a showcase of a couple of projects.


GPIO- we connected 10 LED diodes to the board and made them simulate a moving bar by turning them on and off like this:

PWM- this was a project to make the board flash certain colors at certain times with pulse modulation.
